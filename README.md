## <a id="about-me"></a>About Me

Hi, I’m Deepeka — a data professional with 8 years of experience in Data Engineering and currently pursuing my Master’s in Advanced Data Analytics.

I specialize in ETL development, data analytics, and business intelligence, and more recently, I’ve been working on machine learning, NLP, and AI/LLM-powered applications.

My background spans across healthcare, banking, and pharma domains, where I’ve built scalable data pipelines, production-grade systems, and actionable dashboards to support critical decision-making.

I'm passionate about building AI tools that solve real-world problems—from campus safety assistants to generative search systems.

Currently exploring opportunities where I can combine my engineering foundation, ML skills, and project experience to drive innovation and business impact.

**1. Agentic AI - Clinical Trial Research Agent**

![image](https://github.com/deepekaguru/Portfolio/blob/main/Screenshot%202026-01-28%20105123.png)

Key Highlights:

Local Execution: Runs entirely on-device (via Ollama) to ensure 100% data privacy—a critical requirement for healthcare applications.

Stateful Orchestration: Utilizes LangGraph to manage complex cycles between reasoning, tool usage (API calls), and safety verification.

Built-in Safety: Features an integrated Safety Node that detects high-risk medical queries and automatically appends regulatory disclaimers.

Interactive Dashboard: A custom Streamlit UI that provides clickable links to official NIH study records and live status tracking of the agent's "thinking" process.

Tech Stack: Python | LangGraph | Llama 3.2 (Ollama) | Streamlit | ClinicalTrials.gov API | Custom CSS

**2. Integrated Business Analytics Dashboard (PostgreSQL + Power BI)**

Designed and implemented an interactive Business Analytics dashboard using PostgreSQL and Power BI to analyze multi-domain business performance across sales, HR, and marketing.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepekaguru/Portfolio/main/Postgresql_project.png)


Key Highlights:

• Developed normalized relational schema in PostgreSQL with sales, products, employees, departments, and campaign data.

• Built Power BI connection via Npgsql for live data import and created measures using DAX for KPIs such as Total Revenue, ROI %, Average Transaction Value, Fraud Rate %,    and Department Salary Analysis.

• Designed interactive visuals including bar charts, line trends, donut charts, and KPIs to track product sales, employee performance, and fraud patterns.

• Applied data storytelling principles to highlight key insights such as top-performing products, salary variance across departments, and monthly revenue fluctuations.

• Delivered a professional end-to-end workflow: database design → data modeling → visualization → insight generation.

**Tools & Tech: PostgreSQL| Power BI| DAX| SQL| Data Modeling| Visualization**

**3.DrugInfoGen – AI-Powered Drug Information Assistant (LLM App with Streamlit)**

Built an interactive Streamlit application that generates human-readable drug information based on user-input drug names or selected health conditions. The app uses OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to return structured details including usage, side effects, precautions, and summaries in markdown format.
