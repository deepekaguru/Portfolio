## <a id="about-me"></a>About Me

Hi, I’m Deepeka — a data professional with 8 years of experience in Data Engineering and currently pursuing my Master’s in Advanced Data Analytics.

I specialize in ETL development, data analytics, and business intelligence, and more recently, I’ve been working on machine learning, NLP, and AI/LLM-powered applications.

My background spans across healthcare, banking, and pharma domains, where I’ve built scalable data pipelines, production-grade systems, and actionable dashboards to support critical decision-making.

I'm passionate about building AI tools that solve real-world problems—from campus safety assistants to generative search systems.

Currently exploring opportunities where I can combine my engineering foundation, ML skills, and project experience to drive innovation and business impact.

**1. Agentic AI - Clinical Trial Research Agent**

![image](https://github.com/deepekaguru/Portfolio/blob/main/Screenshot%202026-01-28%20105123.png)

Key Highlights:

Local Execution: Runs entirely on-device (via Ollama) to ensure 100% data privacy—a critical requirement for healthcare applications.

Stateful Orchestration: Utilizes LangGraph to manage complex cycles between reasoning, tool usage (API calls), and safety verification.

Built-in Safety: Features an integrated Safety Node that detects high-risk medical queries and automatically appends regulatory disclaimers.

Interactive Dashboard: A custom Streamlit UI that provides clickable links to official NIH study records and live status tracking of the agent's "thinking" process.

**Tech Stack: Python | LangGraph | Llama 3.2 (Ollama) | Streamlit | ClinicalTrials.gov API | Custom CSS**

**2. Integrated Business Analytics Dashboard (PostgreSQL + Power BI)**

Designed and implemented an interactive Business Analytics dashboard using PostgreSQL and Power BI to analyze multi-domain business performance across sales, HR, and marketing.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepekaguru/Portfolio/main/Postgresql_project.png)


Key Highlights:

• Developed normalized relational schema in PostgreSQL with sales, products, employees, departments, and campaign data.

• Built Power BI connection via Npgsql for live data import and created measures using DAX for KPIs such as Total Revenue, ROI %, Average Transaction Value, Fraud Rate %,    and Department Salary Analysis.

• Designed interactive visuals including bar charts, line trends, donut charts, and KPIs to track product sales, employee performance, and fraud patterns.

• Applied data storytelling principles to highlight key insights such as top-performing products, salary variance across departments, and monthly revenue fluctuations.

• Delivered a professional end-to-end workflow: database design → data modeling → visualization → insight generation.

**Tools & Tech: PostgreSQL| Power BI| DAX| SQL| Data Modeling| Visualization**

**3.DrugInfoGen – AI-Powered Drug Information Assistant (LLM App with Streamlit)**

Built an interactive Streamlit application that generates human-readable drug information based on user-input drug names or selected health conditions. The app uses OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to return structured details including usage, side effects, precautions, and summaries in markdown format.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepekaguru/Portfolio/main/DrugInfoGen.png)


Key Highlights:

• Integrated OpenAI’s LLM to dynamically generate concise, patient-friendly medication details

• Designed dual search modes: by drug name (typed input) and by condition (dropdown)

• Used regex logic to extract and display markdown content into expandable Streamlit sections

• Applied custom theming and CSS for a polished medical assistant-style user experience

• Secured API key management with .env, and prepared app for deployment on Streamlit Cloud

**Tools & Tech: Python|Streamlit|OpenAI API (GPT-4)|Regex|dotenv|Git**


**4. Retail Sales Tax Forecasting - Machine Learning (Time Series Forecasting)**

Developed an interactive forecasting tool using Facebook Prophet to predict quarterly retail sales tax revenue across Iowa cities and counties. The app was built with Streamlit and enables users to select a location, define forecast horizons (1–8 quarters), and visualize trends using dynamic charts.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5281054d-8adc-48b6-858d-af55beb9c671)

Key Highlights:

•	Implemented time series modeling with Prophet, fine-tuned for quarterly seasonality

•	Calculated evaluation metrics including MAPE, MAE, RMSE, and R²

•	Designed a user-friendly interface with Streamlit, supporting tooltip guidance and data filtering

•	Deployed the interactive app on Streamlit Community Cloud with shareable forecasting visualizations
